The Union Budget 2025-26, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2025, marks a significant milestone in India's journey towards becoming a developed nation by 2047. The budget introduced several transformative measures with a total expenditure outlay of Rs 47.66 lakh crore. Key highlights include a substantial increase in capital expenditure to Rs 12.5 lakh crore, representing an 11.1% growth over the previous year. The government announced major initiatives in infrastructure development, including the expansion of metro rail networks to 25 new cities and the development of three major economic railway corridors under the PM Gati Shakti program.

The budget also introduced revolutionary reforms in taxation and social welfare schemes. A new simplified tax regime was implemented to boost compliance and reduce the burden on middle-class taxpayers. The government expanded its flagship programs, with Rs 1.5 lakh crore allocated for housing under PM Awas Yojana and Rs 2 lakh crore for the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Significant emphasis was placed on green energy transition, with Rs 75,000 crore allocated for solar power projects and electric vehicle infrastructure.
